# Data Structures

A collection of custom data structures and algorithms.

--> To demonstrate and cement comprehension of functionality of important data structures and algorithms.

Each struct has a readme which lists its methods and their runtimes (to add:and elucidates uses and pros/cons). Accompanying each implementation is a test script.

Additionally, some exercises from CTCI are included. Tests for them are modified from [here](https://github.com/careercup/ctci/tree/master/javascript/test).
