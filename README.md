# Data Structures

A collection of custom data structures and algorithms.

--> To demonstrate and cement comprehension of functionality of important data structures and algorithms.

Each struct has a readme which lists its methods, explains its runtime, and elucidates uses and pros/cons. Accompanying each implementation is a test script, with one example of n=10 and one of n=1000, to emphasize runtimes.
